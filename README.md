# Variant-calling-for-the-beginners
This pipeline will show you how to make a variant call step by step using different publickly available tools.
Initially a .sh file will be given which contains a newly build variant calling pipeline.
Gradually the whole section will be illustrated.

There are lots of available tools for varient calling. Some combination of tools produces best variant call result.
In this section I enlist the tools which are used for variant calling operation.
